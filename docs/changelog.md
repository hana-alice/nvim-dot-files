# Neovim Config Changelog

Working log for every change inside `~/AppData/Local/nvim/`. Every commit
should add an entry here even if it's tiny — the goal is total recall across
sessions, not curated release notes. When entries pile up, slice off a
versioned `RELEASE_vX.Y.Z.md` (see `release_1.0.0.md` for the format) and
keep this file rolling forward as the unreleased section.

## Entry template

```
### YYYY-MM-DD — Short title

**Task** (one line — why you touched the config)

**Implemented**
- bullet list of concrete changes (file paths + function names)

**Pitfalls / Gotchas**
- traps hit during the change, with the fix

**Validation**
- how you proved it works (headless probe, live nvim test, etc.)

**Follow-ups**
- links to `.hermes/plans/*.md` or TODO bullets
```

## How to use

1. Before touching anything under `~/AppData/Local/nvim/`, skim the latest
   N entries here. Fresh sessions don't carry context — this is where you
   recover it.
2. After landing a change (even a one-line patch), append an entry. The
   **Validation** field MUST state which regression scope you ran (a filter
   like `dap`/`commands`, or full `nvim --headless -l tests/run.lua`) and the
   result — see `docs/testing-regression.md` for the change→filter map.
3. When 8–12 entries have piled up OR a coherent multi-change effort wraps,
   cut a **milestone**: bump the version by semver (BREAKING→major, new
   capability→minor, fix→patch), move entries into `docs/release_vX.Y.Z.md`,
   run the **full** regression as a gate, tag the commit (`vX.Y.Z`,
   confirm with the user first), and leave a one-line cross-link under
   "Released" below. If the milestone touched architecture, also update
   `memory/` and `docs/architecture/overview.md`. (Authoritative: root
   `CLAUDE.md` Definition of Done; `docs/CONSTRAINTS.md §三 C7/C8`.)
